# In-person challenge

Quantum computers have many exciting known uses for understanding our world. But, if the arc of classical computing is any guide, there are many quantum applications yet to discover for creating something wholly new.

For this challenge, you must use a quantum computer to *generate* something new.

Some ideas:
 - Make music with a quantum computer (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.12408.pdf)
 - Render graphics with a quantum ray tracer (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.12797.pdf)
 - Use procedural generation to make a new world (https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11510)
 - Make a QGAN (https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03924)

Once you've debugged your code with regular simulation, please try our noisy simulators before graduating to hardware (if you have time). Hardware noise can have unexpected effects!

We will judge your entry based on both (1) how quantum it is and (2) how cool it is. 

Happy hacking!
